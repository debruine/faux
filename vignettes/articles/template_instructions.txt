=== Reproducible Report for {student_id} ===

Your questionnaire measures {topic}. Your research question is to determine if the {topic} score differs by {iv} for the subset of the sample where {subset} is {level}.

The {quest_n} {topic} questionnaire items are on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high), but some of the items need to be reverse-coded. This is indicated by the letter R in the question column name. You create the {topic} score by summing the questions.

Watch out for missing data. You can decide whether to omit subjects with missing data or replace the missing data; just explain your choice and its consequences in the report.

The report should be written like a summary document for your PI. You don't need to show your code in the rendered report. Include summary tables and/or plots with subject demographics from both the full data set and the subset you'll analyse. Visualise the relationship of interest. Conduct a GLM analysis to answer the research question above. Finally, do a power analysis to determine the sample size you would need to have {power}% power to detect a 0.5-point difference between the levels of {iv} with an alpha criterion of {alpha}.
