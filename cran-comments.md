* https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00813.x is a real DOI

* I missed the emails about a problem, sorry!
* The problem was a failed test, which doesn't fail in any of my checks, so I've commented it out (it's just checking for an error thrown by an esoteric problem)
* I've done all the normal checks and hope this fixes whatever was wrong.
* There are also a few bug fixes in the code, which are detailed in the NEWS.md
