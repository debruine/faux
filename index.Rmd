It is useful to be able to simulate data with a specified structure. The `faux` package provides some functions to make this process easier. See the [vignettes](articles/) for more details.

## Installation

You can install the released version of faux (0.0.1.6) from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("faux")
```

And the development version (0.0.1.7) from [GitHub](https://github.com/debruine/faux) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("debruine/faux")
```

## Quick overview

### Simulate data for a factorial design

```{r plot-sim-design, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, fig.cap="Default design plot"}
between <- list(pet = c(cat = "Cat Owners", 
                        dog = "Dog Owners"))
within <- list(time = c("morning", 
                        "noon", 
                        "evening", 
                        "night"))
mu <- data.frame(
  cat    = c(10, 12, 14, 16),
  dog    = c(10, 15, 20, 25),
  row.names = within$time
)
df <- sim_design(within, between, 
                 n = 100, mu = mu, 
                 sd = 5, r = .5)
```


```{r plot-design, fig.cap="Plot the data with different visualisations."}
p1 <- plot_design(df)
p2 <- plot_design(df, "pet", "time")

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 2, align = "v")
```

### Simulate new data from an existing data table

```{r sim-df}
new_iris <- sim_df(iris, 50, between = "Species") 
```

```{r plot-iris-sim, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Simulated iris dataset"}

new_iris %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 1) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(data = "Simulated") %>%
  dplyr::bind_rows(dplyr::mutate(iris, data = "Original")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x") +
  facet_wrap(~data)
```

## Other simulation packages

I started this project as a collection of functions I was writing to help with my own work. It's one of many, many simulation packages in R; here are some others. I haven't used most of them, so I can't vouch for them, but if faux doesn't meet your needs, one of these might.

* [simstudy](https://www.rdatagen.net/page/simstudy/): Simulation of Study Data
* [simr](https://github.com/pitakakariki/simr): Power Analysis of Generalised Linear Mixed Models by Simulation
* [simulator](http://github.com/jacobbien/simulator): streamlines the process of performing simulations by creating a common infrastructure that can be easily used and reused across projects
* [lsasim](https://github.com/tmatta/lsasim): Simulate large scale assessment data 
* [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/): Trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation (DES
* [parSim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parSim/): Parallel Simulation Studies
