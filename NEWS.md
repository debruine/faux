# faux (development version)

# faux 1.2.1.9002 (2024-02-10)

* Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/debruine/faux/issues/107) in `rmulti()` that assigned correlations to the wrong pairs with more than 3 variables (thanks @yann1cks!)
* Made `rmulti()` more efficient by skipping adjusted r simulation for normal-normal pairs
* Added `nbinom2norm()` conversion function, but not sure it works right unless you set `size` and `prob` manually (produces a warning if you don't)

# faux 1.2.1.9001 (2023-07-07)

* Fixed a bug in `interactive_design()` that didn't allow mu, sd or r with more than 0.1 accuracy, and gave incorrect error messages for r specifications with more than 1 value.

# faux 1.2.1 (2023-04-18)

* `add_between()` and `add_within()` don't convert non-character levels to factors any more * submitting to CRAN (sorry for letting it get archived!)

# faux 0.0.1.64 (2021-03-19)

* `sim_design()` should no longer mangle level values in long format if they have underscores
* `sim_design()` should play better with different separator. FOr example, if you set `faux_options(sep = ".")` and have within-subject factors A and B with levels A_1/A_2 and B_1/B_2, your wide data will have columns A_1.B_1, A_1.B_2, A_2.B_1, A_2.B_2

# faux 0.0.1.63 (2021-03-14)

* fixed bug in `sim_design()` where parameters specified as a named vector couldn't be in a different order unless both between and within factors were specified (e.g., `mu = c(A2 = 2, A1 = 1)` resulted in a mu of 2 for A1 and 1 for A2).

# faux 0.0.1.62 (2021-03-13)

* new `sim_joint_dist()` function to simulate the joint distribution of categories
* `sim_df()` no longer breaks if there are NAs in the DV columns

* some functions (`sim_df()` and `messy()`) can choose columns with unquoted names now (e.g., `messy(mtcars, .5, mpg)`)
* `messy()` now takes a vector of proportions so you can simulate different amounts of missing data per selected column
* `sample_from_pop()` is now vectorised

# faux 0.0.1.61 (2021-02-06)

* `get_params()` doesn't require within and between set for data made with faux (that has a "design" attribute)
* fixed bug in `get_params()` where the var column was alphabetised, but the corresponding columns for the correlation table were in factor order
