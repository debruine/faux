\title{Polynomial code a factor}
\usage{
contr_code_poly(fct, levels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fct}{the factor to contrast code (or a vector)}

\item{levels}{the levels of the factor in order}
}
\value{
the factor with contrasts set
}
\description{
Polynomial coding sets the grand mean as the intercept. 
Each contrast tests a trend (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.). This is only suitable for ordered factors.

df <- sim_design(within = list(time = 1:6),
